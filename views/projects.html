    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>I developed several packages for nodejs that have been published on npm.</p>
    
    <h3><a href="/smoke-os/index.html">SmokeOS</a> <small>coded in C, license Affero GPL</small></h3>
    <p>This is by far my largest project, a complete operating system developed from scratch.</p>

    <h3><a href="/npm.html">Npm packages</a> <small>coded in JS, most are licensed under 3-clause-BSD.</small></h3>
    <p>I developed several packages for nodejs that have been published on npm.</p>

    <h3><a href="/gozy.html">Gozy</a> <small>coded in C#.</small></h3>
    <p>Gozy is a GUI library for desktop applications. This is a prelude to what will serve I hope to create desktop on SmokeOS.</p>

    <!-- <h3><a href="/amy.html">Amy Suite</a> <small>coded in C#.</small></h3>
    <p>This is an utilities suite made to manage source code. This project is essentialy to experiment but contains various modules like a lexer, a expression resolver, a compiler for C, a compiler C#, an intel disassembler... Most of them aren't complete, or usable.</p> -->
