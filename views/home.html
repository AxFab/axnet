      Welcome on my personal page. I’m Fabien B., enthusiast system developer.  I build those pages as a portfolio for the program/apps I’m developing. My biggest project is however, by far, my personal operating system.  The project is still really immature, but most of all, developing a   complete operating system takes a freaking amount of times. Doesn't matter, I enjoy developing it.

      I'm both comfortable on really low-level, assembly and close to the hardware. As on high-level,   designing web-apps, desktop software’s, or large scalable systems. Of course   I am more comfortable on some level than other, (always more interested on backend side) but I like to keep track of everything and understand how pieces fits together.
    </p>

      Anyway, Thanks for the interest you have for my website. If you want to know more about me please visit the about section. I try to keep other area of the website less self-oriented.

      Careful, some articles might be really technical. I decided to put a legend for technical requirement in front of my articles:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="badge bdg-lvl1">Novice</span></li>
        <li><span class="badge bdg-lvl2">Initiated</span></li>
        <li><span class="badge bdg-lvl3">Expert</span></li>
      </ul>
